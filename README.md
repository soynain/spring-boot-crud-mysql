# spring-boot-crud-mysql
Repo for practicing more spring, 
I've learned about beans and autowired, two concepts that were difficult to learn for me some time ago. 
Java has been my favorite language and I'm proud that I can finally handle spring essentials.

Less than a crud, this will be a practice for File Upload with spring and some
animation for uploading progress bar.

I will not use any front end framework for this, just pure backend
